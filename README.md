# Wedding-Agency

Back-end system implementing the functions and data organization for wedding agency.

Program was created with idea to simplify the work of professional wedding planners from wedding agencies. Organization of the single wedding is already a hard analytic and organizational task, let alone when we need to prepare them for a dozen of clients.
This program organizes a list of clients and the list of their weddings. Weddings are sorted by dates. In the clients list we have vital information about each of clients: personal details, contact details and the budget they are willing to spend on their wedding.

Additional info and test cases are described in the Program_Documentation.pdf file
